## Description 
This website is a mock website of a ficticious company. the code was refactored to add semantic elements and improve accesiblilty features.

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage 
The page itself has very little functionality. It is more beneficial to study the source code to learn how the content is built in a way that uses semantic HMTL and adheres to good practice related to acessibility. Note the choice of tags for elements and use of alt text on images.
I added comments to the HTML and CSS detailing the changes I made and also explaining aspects of the code. I also added whitespace between blocks of code in the HTML to imporve readabilty for a developer.
